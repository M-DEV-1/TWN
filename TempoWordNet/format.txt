# --------------
# TWnH-1.0 is based on WordNet version 3.0 (WordNet website: http://wordnet.princeton.edu/)
# where each synset of WordNet 3.0 has been assigned by its intrinsic temporal values.
# The 'ID' uniquely identifies a WordNet (3.0) synset.
# 'Name' column represents the terms, with sense number, belonging
# to the synset. 
# 'POS' column represents the morpho-syntactic category of the particular synset belongs. 
# 'Gloss' carries the meaning of the synsets explained with short defining glosses. 
# The values 'Prob_of_being_Past', 'Prob_of_being_Present','Prob_of_being_Future',and 'Prob_of_being_Atemporal' 
# are the probabilities assigned automatically by the TempoWordNet builing process.  
# All columns are separated by white space.
